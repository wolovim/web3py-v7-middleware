# web3.py v7 middleware

Quick syncronous and asynchronous examples of the middleware pattern introduced in [v7](https://web3py.readthedocs.io/en/latest/v7_migration.html) of web3.py.

To run the examples:

- install deps: `pip install web3==v7.0.0b2 python-dotenv`
- add your RPC URL to the `.env` file
- run either `python sync.py` or `python async.py`

If you want to skip all that, sample console output is included at the bottom of each file.
